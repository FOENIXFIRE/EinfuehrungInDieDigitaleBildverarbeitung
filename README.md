## Getting started

## Built with
This project was realised using a software called 'MATLAB'. Beware that 
this software is not free to use and is only freely available for a testing
trial. We were all using a student license which we obtained via the 
university we are currently attending. For further informations concerning
MATLAB please visit the [official website](https://de.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html "MathWorks Website")

## Motivation
This project is a group project. It is part of an lecture at the 
[TUWIEN Univeristy](https://www.tuwien.at/ "TUWIEN Website"). We wanted to
create an interesting image processing project involving cars which we share an
interest in. The recognition of license plates was implemented by a group of
last years students for which reason we were not allowed to choose this as 
the topic of our project. Therefor we chose brand recognition which is not only 
a new topic but also more complex.
